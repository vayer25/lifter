Certainly! Let's go ahead and implement a function for working with CSV files in Python.

I'll create a function that reads data from a CSV file and prints each row. This function will use Python's csv module to handle the file operations.

Example: Reading a CSV File and Printing Rows
python
Copiar
Editar
import csv

def read_csv_file(path):
    try:
        # Open the CSV file in read mode
        with open(path, mode='r') as file:
            # Create a CSV reader
            csv_reader = csv.reader(file)
            
            # Read and print each row
            for row in csv_reader:
                print(row)
    
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file '{path}' does not exist.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Test the function
read_csv_file('example.csv')
How it works:
open(path, mode='r'): This opens the file in read mode.

csv.reader(file): This creates a reader object that will iterate over the rows in the CSV file.

for row in csv_reader: This loops through each row and prints it. Each row is represented as a list of strings, where each string corresponds to a value in a column.

Error Handling:
The function handles the case where the file does not exist by catching a FileNotFoundError and printing an appropriate message.

It also catches any other exceptions with except Exception as e to prevent crashes and prints the error message.

Example CSV file (example.csv):
pgsql
Copiar
Editar
Name,Age,City
Alice,30,New York
Bob,25,Los Angeles
Charlie,35,Chicago
Expected Output:
css
Copiar
Editar
['Name', 'Age', 'City']
['Alice', '30', 'New York']
['Bob', '25', 'Los Angeles']
['Charlie', '35', 'Chicago']
Next Steps:
If you'd like, I can also create a function to write data to a CSV file or work on other tasks like sorting the data. Let me know if you'd like further modifications!





Part	               What it does
import csv	          Loads CSV tools
countries_list	      Your data (as dictionaries)
headers	              Column names
DictWriter	          Writes dictionaries into a CSV
writeheader()	      Adds the column titles
writerows()	          Adds each country as a row
